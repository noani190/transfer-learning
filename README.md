# transfer-learning
In this repo I will be experimenting with transfer learning using different models as base model and run over different datasets, while freezing varying amount of layers.

(Updated) list of evaluated transfer learning models:
1. vit_to_pets_transfer_learning.ipynb - base model: vit-base-patch16-224 image classification model; dataset: Oxford-IIIT Pets Dataset. This is a "hello world" project, a slightly modified version of huggingface notebook example.
